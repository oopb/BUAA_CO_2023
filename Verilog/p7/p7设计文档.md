## 三、思考题

1、请查阅相关资料，说明鼠标和键盘的输入信号是如何被 CPU 知晓的？

> 鼠标和键盘产生中断信号，进入中断处理区的对应位置，将输入信号从鼠标和键盘中读入寄存器。

2、请思考为什么我们的 CPU 处理中断异常必须是已经指定好的地址？如果你的 CPU 支持用户自定义入口地址，即处理中断异常的程序由用户提供，其还能提供我们所希望的功能吗？如果可以，请说明这样可能会出现什么问题？否则举例说明。（假设用户提供的中断处理程序合法）

> 因为这样比较方便管理，一方面只要出现中断就可以在下一个上升沿直接跳转到指定地点而不需要进行任何读取，另一方面我们也能确定这些异常处理程序不会和其他程序有PC冲突。当然用户提供程序也可以，但是这样就让我们需要每次都重新确定这个程序的位置（不是固定值），就很麻烦。

3、为何与外设通信需要 Bridge？

> 因为外设不同，所占据的地址也不同，一旦有很多外设就要在CPU中装入非常多的多路选择器来确定要写入的位置，所以我们可以把选择传输过程抽象成Bridge和CPU分离，便于这个逻辑的管理。

4、请阅读官方提供的定时器源代码，阐述两种中断模式的异同，并分别针对每一种模式绘制状态移图。

> 模式0：载入计数器后开始计时，当计数器倒计时到0的时候就让控制寄存器使能信号变成0。只有当外界给使能信号重新赋值为1才会重新把要计的时间载入计数器；模式1：只要计时器倒计时变成0就自动重新载入，同时使能信号也是只持续一个周期。

5、倘若中断信号流入的时候，在检测宏观 PC 的一级如果是一条空泡（你的 CPU 该级所有信息均为空）指令，此时会发生什么问题？在此例基础上请思考：在 P7 中，清空流水线产生的空泡指令应该保留原指令的哪些信息？

> 宏观指令就会出现PC=0，这显然和现实情况不符。所以需要在暂停时E保留的是PC和BD，这样是为了让这条Nop指令在外部看来和后续的被延迟的指令拥有同样的外部属性。

6、为什么 `jalr` 指令为什么不能写成 `jalr $31, $31`？

> 作为一条跳转指令，如果其延迟槽出错，那么要返回的EPC就是这条跳转指令，但是由于rd和rs完全相同，那么会导致第二次跳转到与第一次不同的位置导致错误（相当于如果rd和rs相等，那么这个操作就不可逆了）。
